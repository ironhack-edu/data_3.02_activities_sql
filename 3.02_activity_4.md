# 3.02 Activity 4

#### Queries

1. Null or empty values are usually a problem. Think about why those null values can appear.
2. Check for transactions with null or empty values for the column `amount`.
3. Count how many transactions have empty and non-empty `k_symbol` (in one query). Hint: consider using the function `sum()` with a condition inside. :wink:
